## Install

```

yarn add esnext-scripts
```

## What?

`esnext-scripts` is set of pre-configured helpers for your next generation Javascript application. With it, you can now fully focus on your valuable implementations instead of playing around with various settings & helpers over and over again. Batteries included:

- Latest EMACScript supports backed by [Babel](https://babeljs.io).
- A mostly reasonable approach to JavaScript by:
  * [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
  * [Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- Delightful JavaScript Testing with
  * [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest)
  * [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme)


## Why?

> How much time you spend on configuring your application boilerplate to make it support the "future" JavaScript spec. each time you start a new project?

> How many times you had been confused by the obsolete `babel` settings (plugins, presets) or even worse, your applications got broken?
